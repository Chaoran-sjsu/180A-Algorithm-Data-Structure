File Multiplier:

In this project you will implement a file copy command that will take as a command line argument which is the name of an existing file and the name of a file or multiple files 
on where the original file will be copied. You must use C++ fsstreams for this project. You must check for basic errors like the source file not existing and the target files 
already existing and provide used with proper error message in stderr.

Your submission will contain main as it is a self contained program and will be turned in via a single file named mcp.cc.

Your executable must be invoked as:

mcp -s source_file_name -t target_file_name

In this case source_file_name will be copied into target_file_name

You can also create multiple target files with the following invocation:

mcp -s source_file_name -t target_file_name -t target_file_name_1 -t target_file_name2

Your program must check that when there are multiple targets they have different names.

The file content may be anything: ASCII or binary
